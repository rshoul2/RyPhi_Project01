__Ideas and construction of our first project__

(6/22/15)
- I'm leaning towards development for Android development. I want to get some mobile
development experience and we can still use develop in Unity for this. Porting to Android
from Unity is fairly simple so it shouldn't be an issue.
- Should we find an artist for animation and models or do we want to do that ourselves?
- (Game Idea) Top down dungeon crawler with very simple mechanics but have some sort of
  mechanic that makes it unique-ish, such as only tapping or certain swipes.
